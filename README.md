# cxxlint

CxxLint is a Web-CAT plugin designed to integrate C++ static code style checking with CxxTest unit testing. The CxxTest suite is included and this plugin is used for Web-CAT only. It uses CxxTest for C++ Unit Testing, and it uses Googleâ€™s cpp linter to perform the style check. The plugin ties all these elements together for use when students submit their homework.

Note: You will need Cxxtest, https://github.com/CxxTest/cxxtest. the folder should be cloned to the cxl folder for it to work properly.
